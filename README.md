# ORs_from_EBSD

The code provides the possibility to generate or analyse the orientation relationship of two phases to each other from EBSD data using pole figures based on the MTEX toolbox (Ver 5.7). 
Its main features are

* modes for automated, semi-automated or manual analysis of distinct grains (ranges)
* inter-granular orientation deviation analysis
* variant determination and statistical evaluation
* change of the possible OR or reference system
* analysis of the orientation angle deviation 

# Installation and requirements

1. install the MTEX toolbar (https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/download)
2. open up 'Tester.mlx'
3. Start the analysis with the ´EBSD_load´-function
